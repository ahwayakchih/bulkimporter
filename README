Bulk Importer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 0.1
Author: Brendan Abbott <brendan@bloodbone.ws>
Build Date: 31 August 2009
Github Repository: http://github.com/brendo/bulk-importer/tree/master
Requirements: Symphony 2.0.6

Uploads a zip of files to a chosen section. 

Very basic at the moment and is hardcoded to work only with the Symphony default image
validator regex.

Will fill the chosen section with a new entry with the name (from the file) and the file.

Only works on the default upload field at this stage.

Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. 	Install the extension to extensions/bulkimporter

Usage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. 	Go to the System -> Bulk Importer menu
2. 	Choose a zip of files to upload to a chosen section.
3. 	Woot

Roadmap
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* 	Ability to link uploaded files to a chosen section
* 	Ability to upload different types of files (user can set ie. csv) which will allow 
	most fields to be filled
* 	Change so that is supports all upload type extensions
* 	Rework so that the image from the zip is somehow $_POST to let the extension use the
	field's default processRawFieldData	function

Extension takes a lot of similar thought to Scott's Mass Multiple Upload Injector
